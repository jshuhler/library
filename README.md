# library
Working on the library project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library)'s Javascript course. 

[Live preview](https://jshuhler.github.io/library/)

Learned a lot about dealing with and manipulating objects and the values within them during this project as well as implementing a basic light mode/dark mode toggle.
