## working notes
### to do
- [X] come up with a way to create a unique book title given an input name and a unique ID (`crypto.randomUUID()`)
- [X] push book objects into the myLibrary array
    - [this helped](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42866809/push-to-array-from-constructor-in-plain-javascript)
- [ ] split the above add to library array piece into a separate function so it can be called individually.

### books
- title
- author
- page count
- read
- id
